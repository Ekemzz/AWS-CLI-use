SCRIPT
âœ… What the script Does
The script tests IAM functionality by:

Defining an array of IAM usernames (e.g. 5 users).

Looping through each name in the array.

For each user:

Attempts to create the IAM user using the AWS CLI.

Checks the result using $? (the command's exit status).

Prints a success or error message based on whether the user was created successfully or already exists.

A control flow of the script is shown below.

1. This image below capture the create_iam_users function. The for-loop utilises user in an array of IAM_USER_NAMES.

2. the image below captures the create_admin_group function. the if-else loop checks for the admin group in the account, and when not found it creates an admin group otherwise, it outputs "Admin group already exist".
